    "## Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the tasks that you must complete for the first task.  You should complete the work in this notebook and ensure that you regularly commit it to your GitHub classroom.  You can choose to include additional python .py files if you wish to create some helper functions to keep this notebook clean.  Make sure they are committed to the GitHub repository too.\n",

    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a small sample dataset of Amazon Review Data.  This notebook talks you through the process of loading that data into Spark SQL and asks you to analyse that data.  On the Block Release day on 18th November (Open Cohort) and 20th November (Ford Cohort) you will have access to a larger dataset hosted in the Cloud.  Much of the day will be spent moving your solutions to the cloud, and answering additional questions which will be set on the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not finish everything during Block Release.  You will have additionl time to reflect on the experience and finalise your code before final submission on 26th November.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Review Data was downloaded from [here](https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) but a small sample is provided with this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the primary aim with this task is not to get the \"correct\" answer, but for you to use the time to become confident with some basic Big Data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LO1** Understand the principles that allow the processing of big data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LO3** Understand the limitations of big data technologies for distributed processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LO3** Demonstrate practical skills required to implement big-data solutions using modern large-scale data and compute infrastructures."
